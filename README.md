# mini-raytracer
> Ray tracing calculates the intersection of rays (essentially lines) with scene geometry.
## Motivation
I took interest in my year 2 IAC module, and this inspired me to design and write a fundamental part of a CPU or GPU. I deduced that writing a raytracer would ultimately benefit me as:
* I would develop my use of C++ and Linux
* I could use my knowledge of linear algebra and vectors in a ray/path tracing context
* this would challenge me (and allow me to get creative)
